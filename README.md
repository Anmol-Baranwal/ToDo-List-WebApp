## üöÄ Features
- #### LIMIT 
There is no limit to how many items you can add, so feel free to use it according to your needs.

- #### ADD a Item
To add a new item, type where New Item is displayed, then click the "+" symbol to add your item.

- #### DELETE a Item
To delete an item, click the checkbox beside that particular item and your item will be deleted.

- #### DELETE the default item in list
Just add a new item and delete the default item, and then it will no longer be there.

- #### Adding a different List
When the TODAY list opens for the first time, let's say you want to create a separate list for work or school. You can do so by adding /home or /school or any other name you choose with your current URL. You can then use the above way to implement the features discussed and build as many lists as you want. <br>
For example, if the current URL is AB.com and you want to add a home list, write AB.com/home instead. It will create your home list, which you can manage and travel through as needed.
